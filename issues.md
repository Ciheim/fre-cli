* `fre pp configure -y file.yaml` only works when inside folder containing schema at the moment
* want to polish up .gitignore file
* deployment via GitLab
* is there a way to check that all python dependencies needed by fre-cli are available in the current python envioronment? Like "python fre.py" or something?
