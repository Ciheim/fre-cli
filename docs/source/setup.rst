Setup
=====

Need to set up Conda environment first and foremost

Going to need Conda for python

need to pip install:
click setuptools


using setup.py, must ensure that it is written in accordance with fre.py and pip install . (these instructions are better explained in /pdf_guides/Setuptools Integration -- Click Documentation (8.1.x).pdf)

this will allow fre.py to be ran with fre in the command line instead of python fre.py

run pip install . to install packages from setup.py





Enter commands and follow --help messages for guidance
Can run directly from root directory, no need to cd into /fre/

May need to deactivate environment and reactivate it in order for changes to apply
